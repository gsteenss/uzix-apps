This is release 1.0 of sash, my stand-alone shell for Linux.

The purpose of this program is to make replacing of shared libraries
easy and safe.	It does this by firstly being linked statically, and
secondly by including many of the standard utilities within itself.
Read the sash.1 documentation for more details.

Type "make install" to build and install the program and man page.

This is a slightly modified version of sash which works under ELKS.

30th April 1997
Added config.h to configure in the various built in commands. This is
essentially so that

a) a simple shell without builtins

b) a medium size shell with some useful builtins, but not too much bulk

c) a full stand alone shell with all the high level features

can all be built from the one source tree.
Just edit config.h and comment out the #defines for the builtins you don't
want.

8th May 1997
Added stand_alone/ subdirectory which contains stand alone versions of
almost all the builtin commands. These can be used in association with a
sash compiled without these commands, or with any other shell.

To install take a root disk with init and login from the elkscmd/initlogin
directory in the bin directory. Install sash as /bin/sh, and copy the
binaries from the stand-alone directory into the bin directory of the disk.

This is a (almost heavily) modified version of SASH that works with UZIX.
Commands and features were added and enhanced and bugs were fixed.
